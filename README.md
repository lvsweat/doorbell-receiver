# doorbell-receiver

This project is meant to aid doorbell accessibility at my current workplace. Currently, you have to be able to hear the doorbell receiver to know the doorbell was rang, so wearing headphones is not an option at the moment.

This is meant to be the firmware that runs on an ESP32, using the Arduino framework, to receive the rf signal transmitted by the doorbell. (The specific doorbell will be noted in later versions)
